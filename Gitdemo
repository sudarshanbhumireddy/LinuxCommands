Git is responsible for everyting that done similar to gitub but that happens on your local computer
To put your project on github you need to create a repository for it.
fork is a copy of repository. forking a repository allows you freely experiment with changes that will not affect original project.
A commit is a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point of time.
You can interact with people, repositories, and organizations on GitHub. See what others are working on and who they're connecting with from your personal dashboard.
When you follow someone on GitHub, you'll get notifications on your personal dashboard about their activity. click follow on persons profile page to follow them.
